    "- Variables: Used to store data.\n",
    "- Data Types: Defines the type of data stored in a variable (e.g., integers, floats, strings, booleans).\n",
    "- Operators: Perform operations on data (e.g., arithmetic, comparison, logical).\n",
    "- Control Flow: Dictates the order of execution (e.g., if-else statements, loops).\n",
    "- Functions: Reusable blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate:\n",
    "- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets: Data structures for storing collections of data.\n",

    "- Regular Expressions: Powerful pattern-matching tools.\n",
    "- Decorators: Modify the behavior of functions or classes.\n",
    "- Generators: Memory-efficient way to create iterators.\n",
    "- Context Managers: Manage resources efficiently (e.g., opening and closing files).\n",
    "- Metaclasses: Classes that create other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Interesting Concepts:\n",
    "- Concurrency: Executing multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously.\n",
